# Pinecone Visual Lab

Follow `GITHUB_COLLAB_WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md` for Issue → push → ChatGPT PR/review → user merge; obey project branch protections.

- Work in this existing Windows checkout with PowerShell and Git for Windows. Read `docs/BRANCH_POLICY.md` first.
- One phase = one Issue = one feature branch = one Draft PR. D01 is Issue #1, `feature/issue-1-foundation`, integration base `main`.
- Agent implements/tests/commits/pushes through `scripts/push_issue_branch.ps1`. ChatGPT opens the Draft PR and independently reviews. Only the user decides merge.
- Do not push main, force-push, bypass hooks, reset/clean/stash user changes, open PRs, close Issues, or start another phase without assignment.
- Keep the authentic workflow file unchanged. Project-specific configuration belongs in `docs/BRANCH_POLICY.md`.
- Run `scripts/check.ps1` before push. Never fabricate test status, data, model availability, or cloud telemetry.
- D01 implements only the runnable shell, health API, design foundation, Git safeguards, and CI. D02–D09 remain planned. No model downloads, cloud resources, or paid services.
